.SS "For committers "
.PP
When looking at pull requests, first check for \fCproper commit messages\fP\&.
.PP
Do not merge pull requests directly through GitHub's interface\&. Most pull requests are a single commit; cherry-picking will avoid creating a merge commit\&. It's also common for contributors to make minor fixes in an additional one or two commits\&. These should be squashed before landing in master\&.
.PP
\fBMake sure the author has a valid name and email address associated with the commit\&.\fP
.PP
Fetch the remote first: 
.PP
.nf
git fetch [their-fork.git] [their-branch]

.fi
.PP
.PP
Then cherry-pick the commit(s): 
.PP
.nf
git cherry-pick [sha-of-commit]

.fi
.PP
.PP
If you need to edit the commit message: 
.PP
.nf
git cherry-pick -e [sha-of-commit]

.fi
.PP
.PP
If you need to edit the changes: 
.PP
.nf
git cherry-pick -n [sha-of-commit]
# make changes
git commit --author="[author-name-and-email]"

.fi
.PP
.PP
If it should go to the stable brach, cherry-pick it to stable: 
.PP
.nf
git checkout 1-8-stable
git cherry-pick -x [sha-of-commit-from-master]

.fi
.PP
.PP
\fINOTE: Do not cherry-pick into 1-8-stable until you have pushed the commit from master upstream\&.\fP
