.IP "\(bu" 2
Added safety check to make sure that Colorbox's markup is only added to the DOM a single time, even if $\&.colorbox\&.init() is called multiple times\&. This will allow site owners to manually initialize Colorbox if they need it before the DOM has finished loading\&.

Additional callbacks have been added to represent other stages of Colorbox's lifecycle\&.

The 'esc' key is unbound now when Colorbox is not open, to avoid any potential conflicts\&.

Fixed a bug with trying to set a value for rel during a direct call to Colorbox\&. Example: `$\&.colorbox({rel:'foo', open:true});`

More accurate Ajax auto-sizing if the user was depending on the #cboxLoadedContent ID for CSS styling\&.

Note: If you are upgrading, update your jquery\&.colorbox\&.js and colorbox\&.css files\&.
.IP "\(bu" 2
Added photo resizing\&.
.IP "\(bu" 2
Added a maximum width and maximum height\&. Example: {height:800, maxHeight:'100'}, would allow the box to be a maximum potential height of 800px, instead of a fixed height of 800px\&. With maxHeight of 100% the height of Colorbox cannot exceed the height of the browser window\&.
.IP "\(bu" 2
Added 'rel' setting to add the ability to set an alternative rel for any Colorbox call\&. This allows the user to group any combination of elements together for a gallery, or to override an existing rel\&. attribute so those element are not grouped together, without having to alter their rel in the HTML\&.
.IP "\(bu" 2
Added a 'photo' setting to force Colorbox to display a link as a photo\&. Use this when automatic photo detection fails (such as using a url like 'photo\&.php' instead of 'photo\&.jpg', 'photo\&.jpg#1', or 'photo\&.jpg?pic=1')
.IP "\(bu" 2
Removed the need to ever create disposable elements to call colorbox on\&. Colorbox can now be called directly, without being associated with any existing element, by using the following format: `$\&.colorbox({open:true, href:'yourLink\&.xxx'});`
.IP "\(bu" 2
Colorbox settings are now persistent and unique for each element\&. This allows for extremely flexible options for individual elements\&. You could use this to create a gallery in which each page in the gallery has different settings\&. One could be a photo with a fade transition, next could be an inline element with an elastic transition with a set width and height, etc\&.
.IP "\(bu" 2
For user callbacks, 'this' now refers to the element colorbox was opened from\&.

.IP "\(bu" 2
Changed how the JS is structured to be better organized and increase compression\&. Increased documentation\&.
.IP "\(bu" 2
Changed CSS :hover states to a \&.hover class\&. This sidesteps a minor IE8 bug with css hover states and allows easier access to hover state user styles from the JavaScript\&.
.IP "\(bu" 2
Changed: elements added to the DOM have new ID's\&. The naming is more consistent and less likely to cause conflicts with existing website stylesheets\&. All stylesheets have been updated\&.
.IP "\(bu" 2
Changed the behavior for prev/next links so that Colorbox does not get hung up on broken links\&. A visitor can now skip through broken or long-loading links by clicking prev/next buttons\&.
.IP "\(bu" 2
Changed the naming of variables in the parameter map to be more concise and intuitive\&.
.IP "\(bu" 2
Removed colorbox\&.css\&. Combined the colorbox\&.css styles with jquery\&.colorbox\&.js: the css file was not large enough to warrant being a separate file\&.

.IP "\(bu" 2
Changed 'contentWidth' and 'contentHeight' to 'fixedWidth' and 'fixedHeight'\&. These sizes now reflect the total size of the lightbox, not just the inner content\&. This is so users can accurately anticipate % sizes without fear of creating scrollbars\&.
