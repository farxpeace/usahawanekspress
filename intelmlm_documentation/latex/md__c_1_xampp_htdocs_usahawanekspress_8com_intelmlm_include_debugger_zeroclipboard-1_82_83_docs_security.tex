We try our best to keep \hyperlink{class_zero_clipboard}{Zero\-Clipboard} secure but there are some rules that you should follow to keep your site safe.

\paragraph*{Rules}

Basically, if an attacker gets access to the main window/global object via an X\-S\-S exploit, it's pretty much an instant \char`\"{}\-G\-A\-M\-E O\-V\-E\-R\char`\"{} unless {\bfseries A\-L\-L} of the following are true\-:
\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item The {\ttfamily \hyperlink{class_zero_clipboard}{Zero\-Clipboard}} object itself is not globally accessible.
\item The {\ttfamily Zero\-Clipboard.\-prototype} object itself is not globally accessible.
\item No {\ttfamily \hyperlink{class_zero_clipboard}{Zero\-Clipboard}} instances are globally accessible.
\item No callback functions for dispatched \hyperlink{class_zero_clipboard}{Zero\-Clipboard} events are globally accessible.
\item If a variable is used to set the path to the S\-W\-F via {\ttfamily Zero\-Clipboard\-::set\-Defaults}, that variable must not be globally accessible.
\end{DoxyEnumerate}

\paragraph*{Examples}


\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item Having {\ttfamily \hyperlink{class_zero_clipboard}{Zero\-Clipboard}} instances globally accessible (versus encapsulated in a closure). This allows an attacker to manually call a client's {\ttfamily set\-Text} method and inject their own text.
\item As with all globally accessible functions in Java\-Script, any globally accessible callback functions (hooked to events) can be overridden by an attacker. This isn't terribly dangerous but could be annoying.
\item Overriding any of the {\ttfamily \hyperlink{class_zero_clipboard}{Zero\-Clipboard}} or {\ttfamily Zero\-Clipboard.\-prototype} properties or methods, if globally accessible.
\end{DoxyEnumerate}
