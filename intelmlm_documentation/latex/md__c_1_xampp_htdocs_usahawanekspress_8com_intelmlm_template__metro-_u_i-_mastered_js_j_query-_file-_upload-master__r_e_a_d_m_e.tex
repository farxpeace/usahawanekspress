\subsection*{Requirements}

\subsubsection*{Mandatory requirements}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item \href{http://jquery.com/}{\tt j\-Query} v. 1.\-6+
\item \href{http://api.jqueryui.com/jQuery.widget/}{\tt j\-Query U\-I widget factory} v. 1.\-9+ (included)
\item \href{https://github.com/blueimp/jQuery-File-Upload/blob/master/js/jquery.iframe-transport.js}{\tt j\-Query Iframe Transport plugin} (included)
\end{DoxyItemize}

The j\-Query U\-I widget factory is a requirement for the basic File Upload plugin, but very lightweight without any other dependencies from the j\-Query U\-I suite.

The j\-Query Iframe Transport is required for \href{https://github.com/blueimp/jQuery-File-Upload/wiki/Browser-support}{\tt browsers without X\-H\-R file upload support}.

\subsubsection*{Optional requirements}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item \href{https://github.com/blueimp/JavaScript-Templates}{\tt Java\-Script Templates engine} v. 2.\-5.\-3+
\item \href{https://github.com/blueimp/JavaScript-Load-Image}{\tt Java\-Script Load Image library} v. 1.\-11.\-0+
\item \href{https://github.com/blueimp/JavaScript-Canvas-to-Blob}{\tt Java\-Script Canvas to Blob polyfill} v. 2.\-1.\-0+
\item \href{https://github.com/blueimp/Gallery}{\tt blueimp Gallery} v. 2.\-12.\-0+
\item \href{http://getbootstrap.com/}{\tt Bootstrap C\-S\-S framework} v. 3.\-0.\-0+
\item \href{http://glyphicons.com/}{\tt Glyphicons}
\end{DoxyItemize}

The Java\-Script Templates engine is used to render the selected and uploaded files for the Basic Plus U\-I and j\-Query U\-I versions.

The Java\-Script Load Image library and Java\-Script Canvas to Blob polyfill are required for the image previews and resizing functionality.

The blueimp Gallery is used to display the uploaded images in a lightbox.

The user interface of all versions except the j\-Query U\-I version is built with Twitter's \href{http://getbootstrap.com/}{\tt Bootstrap} framework and icons from \href{http://glyphicons.com/}{\tt Glyphicons}.

\subsubsection*{Cross-\/domain requirements}

\href{https://github.com/blueimp/jQuery-File-Upload/wiki/Cross-domain-uploads}{\tt Cross-\/domain File Uploads} using the \href{https://github.com/blueimp/jQuery-File-Upload/blob/master/js/jquery.iframe-transport.js}{\tt Iframe Transport plugin} require a redirect back to the origin server to retrieve the upload results. The \href{https://github.com/blueimp/jQuery-File-Upload/blob/master/js/main.js}{\tt example implementation} makes use of \href{https://github.com/blueimp/jQuery-File-Upload/blob/master/cors/result.html}{\tt result.\-html} as a static redirect page for the origin server.

The repository also includes the \href{https://github.com/blueimp/jQuery-File-Upload/blob/master/js/cors/jquery.xdr-transport.js}{\tt j\-Query X\-Domain\-Request Transport plugin}, which enables limited cross-\/domain A\-J\-A\-X requests in Microsoft Internet Explorer 8 and 9 (I\-E 10 supports cross-\/domain X\-H\-R requests). The X\-Domain\-Request object allows G\-E\-T and P\-O\-S\-T requests only and doesn't support file uploads. It is used on the \href{http://blueimp.github.io/jQuery-File-Upload/}{\tt Demo} to delete uploaded files from the cross-\/domain demo file upload service.
